                    The department is actively involved in R&D as well as consultancy projects and has collaborations with several industries, academic institutes and R&D organizations in the country.
                    The first B. Tech batch graduated in 1991 and the first M.Tech. batch graduated in 2009. 
                    There are more than 20 full-time research scholars registered in the department.
                    The department has good laboratory facilities with adequate number of desktops. 
                    Different types of servers like those by IBM, Apple, HP, Dell, etc. are installed in the laboratories. 
                    The laboratories are open round the clock and are operated and managed by the students themselves. 
                    The students also get access to laser and ink-jet printers. 
                    For research work, the department regularly procures specialized hardware and software packages as required for the specific research project. 
                    The institute has a very good networking facility.</p>

                <p> Chemical engineers combine mathematics, chemistry, physics, biology, and economics to tackle challenging fundamental and large-scale industrial problems 
                    by developing theories, advanced simulations, and experiments.
                    The club provides a platform for young minds to experiment and innovate, and come up with something extra ordinary solutions for the present 
                    and futuristic challenging scientific and societal problems.
                    Indian Institute Of Chemical Engineers (IIChE) is a confluence of streams of professionals from academia, research institute and industry. 
                    It provides them the appropriate forum for joint endeavors, hand-in-hand, to work for human being through application of chemical engineering and allied sciences.
                    This department has a good result.It has a very good amount of placement percentage.
                    This department has very good faculties. It has very good labs. Labs of this departmentare fully furnished.
                    There are all the equipments needed in the lab.Chemical Lab is a very big hall having fascilities for research and development. </p>
